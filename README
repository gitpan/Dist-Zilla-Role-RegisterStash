NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RegisterStash - A plugin that can register stashes

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Dist::Zilla::Role::RegisterStash - released November 21, 2012 as part of
    Dist-Zilla-Role-RegisterStash.

SYNOPSIS
        # in your plugin...
        with 'Dist::Zilla::Role::RegisterStash';

        # and elsewhere...
        $self->_register_stash('%Foo' => $stash);

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes it's handy for a plugin to register a stash, and there's no
    easy way to do that (without touching $self->zilla->_local_stashes or
    somesuch).

    This role provides a _register_stash() method to your plugin, allowing
    you to register stashes. Yes, the leading underscore is intentional: the
    purpose of this method is to allow the consuming plugin to register
    stashes, not anyone else, so this method is private to the consumer.

METHODS
  _register_stash($name => $stash_instance)
    Given a name and a stash instance, register it with our zilla object.
